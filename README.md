You should probably just use VSCode like your coworkers who have personal lives.

Nevertheless, here's an nvim config if you must suffer.

> Note: This config extends NvChad. NvChad comes with pre-configured LSP
> support, Treesitter, and nvim-cmp. Nevertheless, these can be fully customized
> to your liking in './chadrc'. Please refer to the
> [NvChad documentation](https://nvchad.com/) for more information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation / Setup

### üïì Estimated Setup Time: 15 minutes

1. **Neovim**: First, install Neovim. Installation instructions for all
   platforms can be found
   [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim).

2. **NvChad**: Next, set up NvChad per their
   [instructions](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install).

   > **Note**: NvChad reccomends having a Nerd font installed (as do I).
   > Installation is easy. A helpful tutorial can be found
   > [here](https://www.geekbits.io/how-to-install-nerd-fonts-on-mac/). A list
   > of popular nerd fonts can be found at
   > [NerdFonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

3. **Clone this Repository**: Once NvChad is installed, delete the
   `./lua/custom` directory.
   - Next, simply clone this repository into that folder like so:
   ```
   npx degit https://github.com/ByteMyBriefs/nvim-config lua/custom
   ```
   - Run `nvim` in your current directory to open Neovim. Lazy.nvim (your new
     plugin manager) will automatically begin installing all plugins, LSP
     servers, etc.

You should now be good to go ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

**(Optional) Configure AI Plugins**: Lastly, for those of you that want to take
advantage, we need to quickly set up your AI tooling.

- **Copilot.lua && cmp-copilot**: Enter the command `"Copilot auth` and login to
  your Github account. If you have any issues, please see their full
  documentation [here](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua).

> **Note**: An active Copilot account is required.

- **ChatGPT.nvim && NeoAI**: Set an environment variable named `$OPENAI_API_KEY`
  with your OpenAI API key (which you can obtain
  [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)). Configuration settings
  for ChatGPT.nvim and neoai.nvim can be found
  [here](https://github.com/jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim) and
  [here](https://github.com/Bryley/neoai.nvim) respectively.

> **Note**: An active OpenAI API Key is required, but a free key will likely
> last you a very long time by itself.
